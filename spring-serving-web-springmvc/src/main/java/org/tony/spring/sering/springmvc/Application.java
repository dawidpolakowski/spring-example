 * Make the application executable

 * 
 * Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional WAR file for deployment to an external application server, 
 * the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, 
 * driven by a good old Java main() method. Along the way, you use Spring’s support for embedding the Tomcat servlet container as the HTTP runtime, 
 * instead of deploying to an external instance.

/****
 * 
 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
 * @Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 * @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
 * Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. 
 * This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 * @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the GreetingController.
 * The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there wasn’t a single line of XML? No web.xml file either. 
 * This web application is 100% pure Java and you didn’t have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.
